# Project 3 - Task 1

## Description

In this project we implemented the motion model and sensor model for a triton robot in a 2D environment.

## Docs

you can find the lookup_table png file in `scripts/imgs` folder.
also motion_model and sensor_model algorithms are in the scripts folder.

In the script folder, `generate_likelihood_field.py` is used to generate the likelihood field for the sensor model. `motion_model.py` is used to implement the motion model. `sensor_model.py` is used to implement the sensor model.
